# Binary Search Tree 🌴

We are going to be implementing a Binary Tree together! 🎉

Since Trees are a data structure that relies on nodes, I like to think of a Binary Tree as a pre-sorted type linked list. There is a little alorithmic logic to how a BST stores the data.

To get started head over to BinaryTree.py and check out the classes there. There are method stubs that we are going to fill out together!

#### Data structures that rely on nodes

...and a good order to study them in.
